The Data Science team has just built a scraper that gobbled a lot of posts from an Instagram user’s
feed and associated activity. This user posts once a month and comments on other posts on some
specific days.
After a quick chat with your teammates, everybody thought it would be a good idea to model their
social media activity.

1/ Can you write a python script, a self-contained .py file to pass to your teammates, to
(a) parse the json script (below) from the scraper
(b) store the number of (i) posts and (ii)comments on a daily basis across the time period in a python
class
(c) calculate the sum of posts and comments on a daily basis
(d) calculate the aggregate number of posts and comments on a monthly basis
(e) store the monthly totals for the whole period for (i) posts and (ii) comments in a csv file
{ “periodStart”: “15/02/11”,
“periodEnd”: “34/08/21”,
“monthlyPostingDay”: 11,
“comments” : [ [“2/3/21”, “Justin Bieber”, 5], [“5/4/21”, “Lady Gaga”, 6], ], [“5/4/21”, “Snoop Dog”,
2] , [“13/5/21”,”Justin Bieber", 3]]
}



2/ Can you write another python script that takes the following input data as arguments on the
command line:
(i) a lease start date
(ii) a lease end date
(iii) an optional first rent review date (if not supplied use the lease start date as default)
(iv) the rent review frequency (in years)
(v) the rent amount at the start of the lease

and calculate:
a) the rent review dates that would apply during the lease
b) calculate the rent review amount for each rent review if we assume that the rent grows by
n% at each review
